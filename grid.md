why web-based games?

1. games are fun
2. instant gratification for users; no install necessary
3. low commitment in a sandboxed environment
4. fun to bend the rules of what is essentially a glorified document viewer
5. the skills/techniques used are transferrable to other web development endeavors
6. easy to use browser abstractions for update loops and user input

why grid-based games?

1. many game programming concepts are easier with a grid
   a. collision detection is just checking if an (x,y) coord is truthy or falsey
   b. easy to update only the cells that have changed
   c. mouse/touch input is dead simple to map to a grid
   d. lots of games can be "deconstructed" to a grid
